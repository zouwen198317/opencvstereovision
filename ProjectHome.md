This projects is intended for those who would like to get started with OpenCV and  stereo vision. I created a simple StereoVision C++ class that simplifies the development of a 3D calibration and vision system. Qt is used for the interface.

For more information about the project please see the "Stereo Vision with OpenCV and QT"  article:

Includes hardware setup information, calibration tips as well as a demonstration video.

## IMPORTANT UPDATE JULY 3, 2010 ##

Updated code to work with  OpenCV-2.0.0a-win32.exe   (will no longer work with older versions, unless you modify the .pro file).
